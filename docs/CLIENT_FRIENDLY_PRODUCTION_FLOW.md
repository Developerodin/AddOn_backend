## Production Order Flow (Simple Guide for Clients)

This guide explains, in simple language, how your order moves through our production floors from start to finish.

### 1) Order Starts
- We create your production order with a priority and an auto-generated order number.
- The order begins at the KNITTING floor.

### 2) Articles and Their Route
- Each item we make is called an “article.”
- An article has a linking type that sets its route:
  - Auto Linking: KNITTING → CHECKING → WASHING → BOARDING → FINAL CHECKING → BRANDING → WAREHOUSE
  - Hand/Rosso Linking: KNITTING → LINKING → CHECKING → WASHING → BOARDING → FINAL CHECKING → BRANDING → WAREHOUSE

### 3) What We Track on Each Floor
For every floor, we track four numbers:
- Received: how many pieces arrived from the previous floor
- Completed: how many pieces we finished on this floor
- Remaining: how many pieces are still left to process here
- Transferred: how many pieces moved to the next floor

### 4) Floor-by-Floor

#### KNITTING
- We knit the article. Sometimes we produce a few extra pieces (overproduction).
- Example: You planned 100 pieces; knitting produced 110.
- Defective pieces here are counted as “M4” (major defects). Good pieces move forward.

#### LINKING (only for Hand/Rosso Linking)
- Pieces are linked (joined). Auto Linking skips this floor entirely.

#### CHECKING (Quality Check 1)
- We inspect all received pieces and mark them:
  - M1 = Good (can move forward)
  - M2 = Needs repair (we try to fix these)
  - M3 = Minor defect (won’t move forward)
  - M4 = Major defect (won’t move forward)
- We repair the M2 items where possible and upgrade them to M1.
- Only M1 (good) pieces are “completed” and transferred to the next floor.

Step 4B: Article-wise Checked Quantities and M2 Repair Review (Simple)
- M1 (Green): Good, moves forward automatically.
- M2 (Yellow): Needs repair; supervisor reviews and can move items from M2 to:
  - M1 (repaired), M3 (still minor defects), or M4 (major defects).
  - Done in steps of 10 items per action.
- M3 (Orange) and M4 (Red): Do not move forward; they stay recorded here.

#### WASHING
- We wash the good pieces. All washed pieces move to the next floor.

#### BOARDING
- We shape and finish the form of the article. All finished pieces move forward.

#### FINAL CHECKING (Quality Check 2)
- We do a final quality check similar to CHECKING.
- Only M1 (good) pieces are “completed” and transferred to BRANDING.
- Any M3/M4 defects stay here and are recorded.

Step 7B: Final Checking – Article-wise Checked Quantities and M2 Repair Review (Simple)
- Same categories M1–M4.
- If any M2 exist, the supervisor can review and shift M2 to M1/M3/M4 (10 items per action).
- Only M1 moves to BRANDING; M3/M4 remain recorded here.

#### BRANDING
- We add labels/branding. Finished pieces move to the warehouse.

#### WAREHOUSE
- We receive the finished pieces.
- The article and the order are marked completed when all targeted pieces are done.

### 5) Key Rules
- Only M1 (good) pieces move to the next floor.
- M3/M4 (defects) do not move forward and are kept at the checking floors.
- If knitting makes extra pieces, those extras can increase your final delivered quantity.

### 6) What You’ll See in Reports
- Planned vs. Produced vs. Delivered quantities
- How many pieces were good (M1) and how many had defects (M3/M4)
- Floor-by-floor progress (received, completed, remaining, transferred)

That’s it — a clear view of how your order flows from KNITTING all the way to WAREHOUSE, with quality checks ensuring only good items move ahead.
